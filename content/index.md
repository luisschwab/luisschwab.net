# Luis Schwab

I work as an open-source Bitcoin developer, currently funded by the
[BitcoinDevKit Foundation](https://bitcoindevkit.org/foundation/grantees/#luis-schwab),
working mainly on [BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit) and [Floresta](https://github.com/getfloresta/Floresta).

I'm also a Computer Engineering undergrad at Universidade de Brasília, 
where I co-founded [ClubeBitcoinUnB](https://github.com/ClubeBitcoinUnB),
a student club focused on Bitcoin Research, Development, and Education.
